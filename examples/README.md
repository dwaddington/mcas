# Examples

This directory contains general examples of using MCAS with and without ADO.

## Basic

'cpp_basic' : Basic C++ client using MCAS as a plain key-value store.
'python_basic' : Basic Python client using MCAS as a plain key-value store.

## Personalities

These examples provide "personalities" consisting of the ADO, client-side adapter, and test program.

'tabulator_pmdk_fb' : Example ADO using PMDK (side-file). ADO is written in C++ and the client is Python. Protocol based on flatbuffers.
'cpp_list' : C++ ADO manipulating immutable list. Basic demonstration of non-serializing relocation of data structures and ADO operations.
'cpp_symtab' :
'python_numpy' :
'example_fb' :
