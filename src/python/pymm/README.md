# PyMM

PyMM (Python Memory Managed) is a library that integrates local
persistent memory and other memory resources into the Python
programming language.

## TensorFlow

Support for DLPack requires TF v2.6.0 which requires NumPy 1.19.2.  In
building TF from source it was necessary to copy the include directory
contents to the site installation directory.

Some pre-built wheels are available from:
