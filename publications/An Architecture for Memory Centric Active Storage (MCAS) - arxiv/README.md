#An Architecture for Memory Centric Active Storage (MCAS)
## Abstract
The advent of CPU-attached persistent memory technology, such as Intel's Optane Persistent Memory Modules (PMM),
has brought with it new opportunities for storage. In 2018, IBM Research Almaden began investigating and developing
a new enterprise-grade storage solution directly aimed at this emerging technology.
MCAS (Memory Centric Active Storage) defines an "evolved" network-attached key-value store that offers both near-data compute and the ability to layer enterprise-grade data management services on shared persistent memory. As a converged memory-storage tier, MCAS moves towards eliminating he traditional separation of compute and storage, and thereby unifying the data space. This paper provides an in-depth review of the MCAS architecture
and implementation, as well as general performance
results.
