# INSTRUCTIONS

There are a few dependencies you will need:
    - pytorch (to compile c++ code)
    - tqdm (only to run the examples, experiments, and tests)
    - tensorflow (only to run the examples, experiments, and tests)

Please make sure that you've built and installed the c++ code to whatever python environment
you're going to use. This can be done from this directory by typing:
```<python_interpreter> setup.py install```
