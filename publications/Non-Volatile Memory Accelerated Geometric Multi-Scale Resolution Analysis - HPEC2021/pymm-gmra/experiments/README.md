# INSTRUCTIONS

Please make sure that you've built and installed the c++ code to whatever python environment
you're going to use. This can be done from the pymm-gmra directory by typing:
```<python_interpreter> setup.py install```

This directory contains all experiment scrips we will need to run on some different datasets. Each dataset is in its own subdirectory, which contains scripts to build the covertree, and (will) contain further subdirectories for DRAM and NVRAM experiments.
